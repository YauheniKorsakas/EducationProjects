In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built on a collection of services that can be developed, tested, deployed, and versioned independently.
Containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files)
are packaged together as a container image.
The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a container image instance to the host operating system (OS).
Containers also isolate applications from each other on a shared OS.
Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.
